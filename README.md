    **Answer:** No, static methods cannot be overridden; they can only be hidden.

18. **Question:** Are static methods part of an object's state?
    **Answer:** No, static methods belong to the class and not to individual objects.

19. **Question:** Can you mark a class both final and abstract?
    **Answer:** No, a class cannot be both final (cannot be extended) and abstract (meant to be extended).

20. **Question:** Can an interface extend a class?
    **Answer:** No, an interface can only extend other interfaces, not classes.

21. **Question:** Can you create an object of an abstract class using its reference?
    **Answer:** No, you cannot create objects of abstract classes directly.

22. **Question:** Is a constructor inherited in a subclass?
    **Answer:** No, constructors are not inherited, but they are called during subclass object creation.

23. **Question:** Can you use the "this" keyword within a static method?
    **Answer:** No, the "this" keyword refers to the current instance and cannot be used in static methods.

24. **Question:** Can a class have multiple superclass references?
    **Answer:** No, a class can only have one direct superclass.

25. **Question:** Are constructors of a superclass automatically called when creating a subclass object?
    **Answer:** Yes, the default constructor of the superclass is automatically called unless an explicit constructor call is made using "super."

26. **Question:** Can a class implement multiple interfaces with the same method signature?
    **Answer:** Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces with the same method signature.

27. **Question:** Can a final class have abstract methods?
    **Answer:** No, a final class cannot have abstract methods since it cannot be subclassed.

28. **Question:** Is method overloading determined by return types?
    **Answer:** No, method overloading is determined by method parameters, not return types.

29. **Question:** Can an interface contain instance variables?
    **Answer:** No, an interface cannot have instance variables.

30. **Question:** Can you call an overridden method using a reference of the superclass?
    **Answer:** Yes, you can call an overridden method using a reference of the superclass.

31. **Question:** Can a class be both a subclass and a superclass simultaneously?
    **Answer:** Yes, a class can be both a subclass and a superclass in different parts of the inheritance hierarchy.

32. **Question:** Can an interface extend multiple interfaces?
    **Answer:** Yes, an interface can extend multiple interfaces.

33. **Question:** Is method overriding a compile-time process?
    **Answer:** No, method overriding is a runtime process that involves polymorphism.

34. **Question:** Can you mark an interface method as final?
    **Answer:** No, interface methods are implicitly abstract and cannot be marked as final.

35. **Question:** Are instance variables shared among all instances of a class?
    **Answer:** No, each instance of a class has its own copy of instance variables.

36. **Question:** Can an abstract class have instance variables?
    **Answer:** Yes, an abstract class can have instance variables.

37. **Question:** Is "this" a keyword or a reference variable?
    **Answer:** "this" is a keyword that refers to the current instance.

38. **Question:** Is the "Object" class a subclass of every class?
    **Answer:** Yes, the "Object" class is the ultimate superclass of all classes.

39. **Question:** Can you create an instance of a superclass using a subclass reference?
    **Answer:** Yes, you can create an instance of a superclass using a subclass reference through upcasting.

40. **Question:** Can a class have private constructors?
    **Answer:** Yes, a class can have private constructors to restrict external instantiation.

41. **Question:** Can an abstract class be marked as "final"?
    **Answer:** No, an abstract class cannot be marked as "final" since it's meant to be extended.

42. **Question:** Is "composition" an alternative to "inheritance"?
    **Answer:** Yes, "composition" is an alternative design principle to "inheritance."

43. **Question:** Can you override a non-final method as final in a subclass?
    **Answer:** Yes, you can override a non-final method in a subclass and mark it as final.

44. **Question:** Is encapsulation concerned only with data hiding?
    **Answer:** No, encapsulation involves bundling data and methods together for

 better control and abstraction.

45. **Question:** Can an abstract class extend a concrete class?
    **Answer:** Yes, an abstract class can extend a concrete class.

    **Answer:** No, constructors cannot be generic.

49. **Question:** Are instance methods overridden in Java?
    **Answer:** Yes, instance methods are overridden in Java, not static methods.

50. **Question:** Can an abstract class have a constructor?
    **Answer:** Yes, an abstract class can have a constructor, and it's called when a subclass object is created.
